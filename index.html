				<p>
				Hello There! Welcome to my portfolio site. I'm going on a long journey into full stack web development. I've spent the last 15 years in various IT roles such as help desk, systems administration, project management, and incident management. Upon completion of this journey, I'd like to move into DevOps where I can demonstrate my abilities, and mature as a great developer. Also make a few dollars as well. 
				<br><br>

				Please kindly take a moment to review some of the projects I've created during my time in CodingBootCamp. You'll find some interesting games that help the time pass, along with enterprise level applications that suit business operations needs.
